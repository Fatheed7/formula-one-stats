# F1 Statistics - CI Project 3

![F1 Statistics - Am I Responsive Image](docs/readme_images/responsive.png)

This website was created as a third portfolio project for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development. The site was inspired by my interest in FORMULA 1 as a sport and a desire to have easily accesible information.

The website can be [found here](https://formula-one-statistics.herokuapp.com/).

## Logic

- ## Flowchart

     <details>

    <summary>Show Flowchart</summary>

  ![F1 Statistics Flowchart](docs/readme_images/flowchart.png)
    </details>

I spent time thinking about the logic and flow of the site to make sure I had a rough idea of how things were to be laid out and how each part of the site would interact with the database. The flowchart was created using [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/).

## Design

- ## Background

  I made use of the tool available at [SVG Backgrounds](https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/) for this site for a number of reasons.

  - Due to the background being a scalable vector graphic, it will not lose sharpness or quality as the screen size increases and will remain responsive.
  - Due to being an SVG, the file size of the entire background is around 5kb, greatly reducing the total size of the assets required on page load.
  - The tool offers a large amount of customisation and is free for use, as long as attribution is given.
  - The colour of the background chosen has high contrast against the predominantly grey colour scheme of the main game.

- ## Colours

  - ![#b71c1c](https://via.placeholder.com/15/b71c1c/000000?text=+) - This colour was chosen for the navbar and footer as a subtle nod to the main colour of the official FORMULA 1 logo.
  - ![#03a9f4](https://via.placeholder.com/15/03a9f4/000000?text=+) - This colour is used for the icons on the main page and was chosen as it contrasts well against the striking red colour of the navbar.
  - ![#01579b](https://via.placeholder.com/15/01579b/000000?text=+)
  - ![#000022](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000022/000000?text=+)
  - ![#002266](https://via.placeholder.com/15/002266/000000?text=+)
