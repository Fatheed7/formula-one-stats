# F1 Statistics - CI Project 3

![F1 Statistics - Am I Responsive Image](docs/readme_images/responsive.png)

This website was created as a third portfolio project for Code Institute's Diploma in Web Application Development. The site was inspired by my interest in FORMULA 1 as a sport and a desire to have easily accesible information.

The website can be [found here](https://formula-one-statistics.herokuapp.com/).

## Objective

#

## UX and UI

- ### Site Owner Goals

  The goal of the site for the owner is to:

  1. Create a home for data from all FORMULA 1 circuits, constructors, drivers, races and seasons.
  2. Allow users to easily navigate the site and allow them to save things to their favourites to allow easy access later.
  3. Have an easy way to add data to the database once an event has finished.

#

- ### User Stories

  - #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a first time user, I want to immediately understand the purpose of the website and how to get started.
    2. As a first time user, I want to be able to easily navigate the site, with a clear indication of which page I am currently on.
    3. As a first time user, I want easy access to external information, where available, to content that I find interesting.

  - #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to access any content I've added to my favourites easily, without needing to search for it directly.
    2. As a returning visitor, I want to be able to manage my account by changing my display name, password or deleting my account entirely.

  #

  ## Wireframes

  The wireframes for this site were created using Balasmiq, with each section and subsection noted.

  The sections below show individual wireframes for different devices, covering the home page when not logged in, the profile page once logged in and a generic overiew of most pages on the site.

   <details>

    <summary>Wireframe - Home & Profile</summary>

  The directory containing the wireframe images can be found [here](docs/wireframes/).

#

## Logic

- ## Flowchart

     <details>

    <summary>Show Flowchart</summary>

  ![F1 Statistics Flowchart](docs/readme_images/flowchart.png)
    </details>

I spent time thinking about the logic and flow of the site to make sure I had a rough idea of how things were to be laid out and how each part of the site would interact with the database. The flowchart was created using [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/).

#

## Design

- ## Background

  I made use of the tool available at [SVG Backgrounds](https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/) for this site for a number of reasons.

  - Due to the background being a scalable vector graphic, it will not lose sharpness or quality as the screen size increases and will remain responsive.
  - Due to being an SVG, the file size of the entire background is around 5kb, greatly reducing the total size of the assets required on page load.
  - The tool offers a large amount of customisation and is free for use, as long as attribution is given.
  - The colour of the background chosen has high contrast against the predominantly grey colour scheme of the main game.

- ## Colours

#

- ![#b71c1c](https://via.placeholder.com/15/b71c1c/000000?text=+) - `#b71c1c` - This colour was chosen for the navbar and footer as a subtle nod to the main colour of the official FORMULA 1 logo.
- ![#03a9f4](https://via.placeholder.com/15/03a9f4/000000?text=+) - `#03a9f4` - This colour is used for the icons on the main page and was chosen as it contrasts well against the striking red colour of the navbar.
- ![#01579b](https://via.placeholder.com/15/01579b/000000?text=+) - `#01579b` - This colour was used for the submit buttons at the bottom of the pages for editing drivers & races. This colour was chosen as it contrasts well against the ![#fff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/fff/000000?text=+) white background of the main section, and also against the footer of the page which, as described above, uses the colour ![#b71c1c](https://via.placeholder.com/15/b71c1c/000000?text=+) `#b71c1c`.

#

The below colours were not chosen by myself, but are the default colours chosen for the background used from the site [SVG Backgrounds](https://www.svgbackgrounds.com/). I decided to stick with the default colours of the theme chosen due to the close resemblance with the current livery of the [Williams team](https://www.google.com/search?q=Williams+2022+livery&tbm=isch).

- ![#000022](https://via.placeholder.com/15/000022/000000?text=+) - `#002222`
- ![#002266](https://via.placeholder.com/15/002266/000000?text=+) - `#002266`
- ![#001133](https://via.placeholder.com/15/001133/000000?text=+) - `#001133`

#

- ## Favicon

  The website [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) was used to generate the favicon image for the website. The chequered flag Unicode emoji , üèÅ, was chosen as the icon as it is relative to the theme of the website and is recognisable due to its association with and use in motorsport.

#

# Features

- ## Home Page

  Upon first accessing the site the user is shown the home page which contains 3 main elements.

1.  Navbar

    ![F1 Statistics - Home Navbar](docs/readme_images/home_navbar.png)

    The navbar is shown on all pages and is part of the base.html template. The navbar has 3 different configurations.

- If no user session exists the navbar displays the title of the site on the left side, 'F1 Statistics', and links to either 'Login' or 'Register' on the right side. Alternatively, on mobile devices a hamburger menu icon is shown, with a side nav appearing when pressed.
- If a user session exists, the navbar displays the title of the site on the left side, 'F1 Statistics', and links to all content options and the users profile, as well as the option to log out on the right. Alternatively, on mobile devices a hamburger menu icon is shown, with a side nav appearing when pressed.
- If the admin user is logged in, the navbar displays the title of the site on the left side, 'F1 Statistics', and links to all content options and access to the admin dashboard, as well as the option to log out on the right. Alternatively, on mobile devices a hamburger menu icon is shown, with a side nav appearing when pressed.

#

2.  Hero Section

    ![F1 Statistics - Home Hero Section](docs/readme_images/home_hero.png)

    The hero section contains the main content of the page. It is contained within a div styled with a background of ![#595959](https://via.placeholder.com/15/595959/000000?text=+) `RGBA(89,89,89,0.712)` to contrast it against the background and maintain readability, with a WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) score of 7:1, or Level AAA.

    The section welcomes the user to the site, also containing the name of the site, gives a brief description of the purpose of the website, and clear instructions on the actions the user should take next with emphasis also given to clickable links.

3.  Info Section

    ![F1 Statistics - Home Info Section](docs/readme_images/home_info.png)

    The info section contains 3 seperate divs containing information about the site. The divs are styled with the same background detailed in the hero section, but also each contain animated icons to draw the users attention to the main benefits of using the site. These icons were provided by Font Awesome and have a colour of ![#03a9f4](https://via.placeholder.com/15/03a9f4/000000?text=+) - `#03a9f4` applied as this matches with the background of the main page, but also provides sufficient contrast to remain easily viewable, although the icons themselves are not an important part of the content of the page.

- ## Auth

  - Login

    ![F1 Statistics - Login Page Navbar](docs/readme_images/login_navbar.png)

    The Login page has intentionally been kept as simple as possible to direct the actions by the user without the need for any additional instructions.

    The first noticable difference, and a theme throughout the rest of the site is a div displaying the title of the page. This was achieved by using Jinja2 templating and the use of `{% block title %}` at the head of the page.

    The colour of the login div was intentionally kept the same as that of the navbar, but a shadow was applied to the top of the div to provide some separation between the elements.

    #

    ![F1 Statistics - Login Page Form](docs/readme_images/login_form.png)

    Directly below the header of the page is the form allowing the user to login. The form contains 3 main elements - Username, Password and the login button itself.

    Both the Username and Password fields have been given the following pattern of `^[a-zA-Z0-9]{5,15}$` which has the requirements of:

    - Only containing alphanumeric characters.
    - A minimum length of 5 characters.
    - A maximum length of 15 characters.

    Both fields are marked as required and are validated when the user clicks the 'Log In' button.

    The input field for Username and Password are underlined red whilst the minimum or maximum length requirements are not met, with a tooltip being displayed to the user if they try to submit an invalid form, as shown below.

    ![F1 Statistics - Login Form Validation](docs/readme_images/login_validate.png)

    #

    Below the Login form is a small section for users who have not yet registered and will be unable to login, with the hyperlink directing the customer to the registration page.

    ![F1 Statistics - Login Form Validation](docs/readme_images/login_newhere.png)

    #

    Upon attempting to login, and once validation checks have been passed, the database is accessed in the following manner:

    ![F1 Statistics - Login Form Validation](docs/readme_images/login_schema.png)

    1. The `users` collection is searched for a value matching the username entered into the form in the "username" field.
       - If this fails, the user is returned to the login page and a flash message of `Incorrect Username and/or Password` is displayed.
    2. The `check_password_hash` function from `Werkzeug` is called and is passed the value entered into the password field on the input form. This hashed value is checked against the value held in the `password` field in the `users` collection.
       - If this fails, the user is returned to the login page and a flash message of `Incorrect Username and/or Password` is displayed.
    3. Upon both of the above checks passing, the user is directed to the Profile page, with the `username` value being passed as the current session user.

    The display_name value is not used at any point in the login process, but is described in more detail in the Register and Profile sections.

    #

  - Register

    ![F1 Statistics - Register Page Navbar](docs/readme_images/register_navbar.png)

    As with the Login page, the Register page has intentionally been kept as simple as possible to direct the actions by the user without the need for any additional instructions.

    The colour of the login div was intentionally kept the same as that of the navbar, but a shadow was applied to the top of the div to provide some separation between the elements.

    #

    ![F1 Statistics - Register Page Form](docs/readme_images/register_form.png)

    Directly below the header of the page is the form allowing the user to login. The form contains 3 main elements - Username, Password and the Register button itself.

    Both the Username and Password fields have been given the following pattern of `^[a-zA-Z0-9]{5,15}$` which has the requirements of:

    - Only containing alphanumeric characters.
    - A minimum length of 5 characters.
    - A maximum length of 15 characters.

    Both fields are marked as required and are validated when the user clicks the 'Register' button.

    The input field for Username and Password are underlined red whilst the minimum or maximum length requirements are not met, with a tooltip being displayed to the user if they try to submit an invalid form, as shown below.

    ![F1 Statistics - Login Form Validation](docs/readme_images/login_validate.png)

    #

    Below the Register form is a small section for users who have already registered and are not required to register again, with the hyperlink directing the customer to the log in. page.

    ![F1 Statistics - Already Registered? Link](docs/readme_images/register_already.png)

    #

    Upon attempting to register, and once validation checks have been passed, the database is accessed in the following manner:

    ![F1 Statistics - Register Form Validation](docs/readme_images/login_schema.png)

    1. The `users` collection is searched for a value matching the username entered into the form in the "username" field. Unlike the login form, this check will fail if the username already existing within the database, as the same username cannot be used twice.
       - If this fails, the user is returned to the register page and a flash message of `Username already exists` is displayed.
    2. A new entry is made into the database with the following details:
       - Username is converted to lower case added to the `username` field
       - Username is added, as it was entered in the form, to the `display_name`
       - The `generate_password_hash` from `Werkzeug` is called and this value is added to the `password` field.
    3. A session cookie is created with the name `user` and the value from the `username` field on the register form.
    4. The user is directed to the Profile page, with the `username` value being passed as the current session user and a flash message is shown stating `Registration Successful!`.

  - Logout

    When the user selects the `Logout` button, the session cookie is removed with `session.pop` and the user is directed to the login page.

- ## Note For Sections Below

  A number of the sections below contain similar features as [DataTables](https://datatables.net/) was used to add functionality and, for the purpose of simplicity, I wanted to describe the features present on multiple pages to save on repetition.

  #

  All pages below require a user to be logged in. If a user is not logged in, they will automatically be redirected to the login page.

  #

  All pages share the same design features as the login and register pages and, unless specified, always show the name of the page the user is currently on.

  #

  As the dataset used contains a large amount of data, the main focus of this project was to allow easy viewing and searching and, as described above, [DataTables](https://datatables.net) was used to add pagination and search functionality, plus the ability for the user to select how many entries are displayed on the page.

  ![F1 Statistics - Table Show Entries Selector and Search Box](docs/readme_images/table_entries_search.png)

  ![F1 Statistics - Table Pagination](docs/readme_images/table_pagination.png)

- ## Circuits

  - ### Circuit Overview

    The Circuit page itself is a table of information retrieved from the database (which is described below) and contains the following information:

    - Circuit Name
    - Location (City)
    - Country
    - A button linking to Google Maps using Latitude and Longitude
    - A button linking to the Wikipedia article about the Circuit.
    - A button linking to a more in depth view of the Circuit.

    A `for` loop is used to enter the details of each circuit into a data cell of the table, which is then styled by [DataTables](https://datatables.net).

    The manner in which each field is retrieved from the database is detailed in the image below.

    ![F1 Statistics - General Circuit View](docs/readme_images/circuit.png)

  - ### Circuit View

    Upon clicking the `View` button on the Circuits page, the user is shown a more in depth break down of information about the circuit.

    The user is shown some information that matches the previous page such as the Location, Country and a link to Google Maps for the Circuit.

    Below this section is a table containing all F1 races that have been held at the circuit.

    This is achieved with a `for` loop of the `races` collection, searching for any circuits with a `circuitId` matching that of the current circuit, with all results being output to a table.

    ![F1 Statistics - View Circuit Screen](docs/readme_images/view_circuit.png)

    More information about this page can be found in the [Features To Add](#features-to-add) section.

- ## Constructors

  - ### Constructor Overview

    The Constructor page itself is a table of information retrieved from the database (which is described below) and contains the following information:

    - Constructor Name
    - Constructor Nationality
    - A button linking to the Wikipedia article about the Constructor.
    - A button linking to a more in depth view of the Constructor.

    A `for` loop is used to enter the details of each Constructor into a data cell of the table, which is then styled by [DataTables](https://datatables.net).

    The manner in which each field is retrieved from the database is detailed in the image below.

    ![F1 Statistics - General Constructor View](docs/readme_images/constructor.png)

  - ### Constructor View

    Upon clicking the `View` button on the Constructor page, the user is shown a more in depth break down of information about the Constructor.

    The [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) is called using the constructor `name` as the title of the Wikipedia page. The API returns the head image of the Wikipedia article. If no image exists, the user is instead shown a 'No image available' replacement.

    The user is shown some information that matches the previous page such as the Name and Nationality of the Constructor. Additionally, there is a link to the Wikipedia article at the top of the page.

    Below this section is a table containing race statistics for the selected constructor such as the number race entries, wins, podiums and the percentage of wins the constructor has achieved.

    This is achieved with a `for` loop of the `results` collection, searching for any race entries with a `constructorId` matching that of the current constructor, with all results being output to a table.

    - The number of entries is equal to the number of results of the `for` loop.
    - The number of wins is equal to the number of results with a position of `1`
    - The number of podiums is equal to the number of results with a position of `1`, `2` or `3`.
    - The percentage of podiums is equal to the number of entries divided by the value of the number of podiums.
    - The percentage of wins is equal to the number of entries divided by the value of the number of wins.

    ![F1 Statistics - View Constructor Schema](docs/readme_images/constructor_schema.png)
    ![F1 Statistics - Race Statistics Table](docs/readme_images/view_constructor.png)

    More information about this page can be found in the [Features To Add](#features-to-add) section.

- ## Drivers

  - ### Driver Overview

    The Driver page itself is a table of information retrieved from the database (which is described below) and contains the following information:

    - Driver Forename
    - Driver Surname
    - Driver Code
    - Driver Number
    - Driver Date of Birth
    - Driver Nationality
    - A button linking to the Wikipedia article about the Driver.
    - A button linking to a more in depth view of the Driver.

    A `for` loop is used to enter the details of each Driver into a data cell of the table, which is then styled by [DataTables](https://datatables.net).

    The manner in which each field is retrieved from the database is detailed in the image below.

    ![F1 Statistics - General Driver View](docs/readme_images/drivers.png)

  - ### Driver View

    Upon clicking the `View` button on the Driver page, the user is shown a more in depth break down of information about the Driver.

    The [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page) is called using the Driver `forename` and `surname` as the title of the Wikipedia page. The API returns the head image of the Wikipedia article. If no image exists, the user is instead shown a 'No image available' replacement.

    The user is shown some information that matches the previous page such as the Name, Nationality, Date of Birth and Driver Code for the Driver. Additionally, there is a link to the Wikipedia article at the top of the page.

    Below this section is a table containing race statistics for the selected driver such as the number race entries, wins, podiums and the percentage of wins the constructor has achieved.

    This is achieved with a `for` loop of the `results` collection, searching for any race entries with a `driverId` matching that of the current driver, with all results being output to a table.

    - The number of races is equal to the number of results of the `for` loop.
    - The number of wins is equal to the number of results with a position of `1`
    - The number of podiums is equal to the number of results with a position of `1`, `2` or `3`.
    - The percentage of podiums is equal to the number of races divided by the value of the number of podiums.
    - The percentage of wins is equal to the number of races divided by the value of the number of wins.

    Below the statistics is a chart built using MongoDB charts.

    The chart contains all the data from the results table, but a filter is passed to the MongoDB chart equal to the current driverID, thus only showing the required statstics.

    In early F1 races drivers had a propensity for not finishing due to vehicle unreliability. As such, if a driver did not finish any of the races they entered, no chart is shown.

    ![F1 Statistics - View Driver Schema](docs/readme_images/driver_schema.png)
    ![F1 Statistics - Driver Statistics Table](docs/readme_images/view_driver.png)
    ![F1 Statistics - Driver Chart](docs/readme_images/driver_chart.png)

- ## Races

  - ### Race Overview

    The Race page itself is a table of information retrieved from the database (which is described below) and contains the following information:

    - Race Name
    - Race Date
    - Circuit
    - Season
    - A button linking to the Wikipedia article about the race.
    - A button linking to a more in depth view of the race.

    A `for` loop is used to enter the details of each race into a data cell of the table, which is then styled by [DataTables](https://datatables.net).

    The manner in which each field is retrieved from the database is detailed in the image below.

    ![F1 Statistics - General Driver View](docs/readme_images/races.png)

  - ### Race View

    - ### Qualifying Results

      Upon first loading, the user is shown the Qualifying Results page.

      The data is retrieved from the `qualifying` collection but, unlike other tables on the site, is not formatted using [DataTables](https://datatables.net), but is instead formatted using the styles built into [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/).

      The data is displayed based upon the current qualifying format (of 3 seperate qualifying sessions).

      For current races, this means no Q2 or Q3 data is shown for drivers finishing below 15th, and no Q3 data is shown for drivers finishing below 10th.

      For older races, data will only be displayed in the Q1 column, with all other columns left blank.

      ![F1 Statistics - Qualifying Schema](docs/readme_images/quali_schema.png)
      ![F1 Statistics - Qualifying Example Table](docs/readme_images/quali_example.png)

    - ### Race Results

      The second tab available to the user is the Race Results page.

      The data is retrieved from the `results` collection but, as with the qualifying results, is not formatted using [DataTables](https://datatables.net), but is instead formatted using the styles built into [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/).

      The data displayed shows the finishing order of the race with constructor, points obtained, laps completed and status at the end of the race shown, as in the example below.

      ![F1 Statistics - Race Schema](docs/readme_images/race_schema.png)
      ![F1 Statistics - Race Example Table](docs/readme_images/race_example.png)

    - ### Driver Standings

      The third tab available to the user is the Driver Standings page.

      The data is retrieved from the `driver_standings` collection but, as with the qualifying and race results, is not formatted using [DataTables](https://datatables.net), but is instead formatted using the styles built into [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/).

      The data displayed shows the standings of the Drivers Championship as of the end of the race selected. The table also shows the number of wins they have achieved in the season.

      ![F1 Statistics - Driver Standings Schema](docs/readme_images/driver_standings_schema.png)
      ![F1 Statistics - Driver Standings Example Table](docs/readme_images/driver_standings.png)

    - ### Constructor Standings

      The final tab available to the user is the Constructor Standings page.

      The data is retrieved from the `constructor_standings` collection but, as with the the previous sections, is not formatted using [DataTables](https://datatables.net), but is instead formatted using the styles built into [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/).

      The data displayed shows the standings of the Constructors Championship as of the end of the race selected. The table also shows the number of wins they have achieved in the season.

    <summary>CSS Validation</summary>

  CSS was validated using [The W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator). A full report can be viewed [here](docs/readme_images/CSS_Validation/css_validator_full.png).

    <summary>HTML Validation</summary>

  HTML was validated using [The W3C Nu Html Checker](https://validator.w3.org/nu/). All pages were checked using this tool and most screens have been captured and can be viewed [here](docs/readme_images/HTML_Validation/). Some pages have not been captured due to the large number of lines contained on certain pages.

    <summary>JS / Jquery Validation</summary>

  Javascript/JQuery was validated using [JSHint](https://jshint.com/). Three warnings were returned, but all contained the same information regarding the use of 'let'. As ES6 is the version being used, these warnings were disregarded.

- ## Lighthouse Testing

#

- ## Wave Testing

  All pages on the site were tested using the [WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](https://wave.webaim.org/). All pages returned **0 errors**, **0 contrast errors**. A single Alert was returned on the Login page advising of a redundant link, but I believe this is not valid.

  Due to the number of pages contained on the site, I have not linked the images within this repository, but the site can be explored on the WAVE tool by clicking [this link](https://wave.webaim.org/report#/https://formula-one-statistics.herokuapp.com/).
